# Samples 

A number of sample directories:

## Aspirin 

Contains the following files

* __aspirin-enr.cml__: Anntation XML file with three localisations: English, German, Japanese.
* __aspirin-enr.svg__: The un-annotated SVG file.
* __aspirin-iveo.svg__: Audio-tactile SVG file for IVEO with drill down buttons.
* __aspirin-iveo-without-button.svg__: Audio-tactile SVG file for IVEO without drill down buttons.
* __aspirin-tactile.svg__: Audio-tactile SVG file without IVEO annotation. The
  main difference is that the top-most title and descr elements are inside a
  bounding rectangle for the entire diagram. When hovering in with the mouse in
  a browser the title is displayed as opposed to the IVEO annotated files.


## Chemistry

Additional chemistry samples. 

*Note that all chemistry diagrams use atom, bond, atomSet notation instead of active, passive, grouped.*


### Iveo with Button

Audio-tactile SVG files with drill down buttons and JavaScript event handlers.

### Iveo without Button

Audio-tactile SVG files without drill down buttons.


## Statistics

Statistics samples. They do not yet contain all speech elements for passive elements.
Should be updated in the future.

### Histograms

All histograms have exactly three layers.

### Boxplots

Boxplots can have up to five layers.

### Timeseries

Timeseries currently have at most three layers. They might get more layers in the futures.

## Physics 

The current physics diagram with three layers.
